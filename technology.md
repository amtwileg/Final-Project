# Technology
## Data cleaning and analysis
* `pandas_datareader` will be used to retrieve the data
* `pandas` / `numpy` will be used to perform exploratory analysis and format it into a structure conducive for time series machine learning algorithms.

## Database storage
* This database can easily be kept in memory and retrieved as needed.
* Alternatively, if the data proves too large to fit into memory, we can store the data in a sqlite or psql database.

## Machine Learning
* `sklearn` / `pytorch` / `keras` will be used to build the machine learning time series models. We may also use `statsmodels` to fit an STL model.

## Dashboard
* I plan on using `streamlit` to build a dashboard.
